Name: Matt West
Project Description: A basic business website for a store that sells a variety of games and also has in-person events.
Includes Navbar functionality and responsive elements using bootstrap, uses forms, and includes an event calendar that customers can view.
Technologies used: HTML, CSS
Ideas for future improvement:
1. I plan to add multiple pages to the existing version to fill out the store's product offerings.
2. I plan to eventually add a storefront page intended to allow customers to purchase games, cards, accessories, etc online.
3. I think it'd be a good idea to streamline the site to eliminate any redundancies or complications in the user experience so that users can navigate the site faster and more efficiently.
